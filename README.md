## Simple X-O Game

This is a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game developed using C# and Windows Forms. The game features a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing X and O symbols. It tracks each player's score, highlights the winning combination in green, and displays messages for wins or draws. The interface includes controls to restart the game or reset the scores. All game logic is handled through PictureBox tags, basic enums for player state, and a custom method to check for winners. This project is ideal for beginners learning C# WinForms and basic game logic implementation.
